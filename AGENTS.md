# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/main.ts` boots the Ionic Vue app and wires the router; `src/App.vue` is the shell.
- Page components live in `src/views`, shared layouts or widgets belong in `src/components`, and route tables are in `src/router`.
- Theming goes through `src/theme/variables.css`; prefer updating tokens here instead of inline styles.
- Static assets and icons reside in `public/`; built bundles land in `dist/` and should stay untracked.
- `tests/unit` contains Vitest specs, `tests/e2e` holds Cypress flows, and the `android/` folder is generated by Capacitor—never edit its contents manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies; run again after updating Capacitor or Ionic packages.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server with hot reload at `http://localhost:5173`.
- `npm run build` performs `vue-tsc` type checks and outputs a production bundle to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the built bundle for smoke testing.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint across the project; fix violations before opening a PR.
- `npm run test:unit` executes Vitest suites; `npm run test:e2e` launches Cypress headlessly.
- For native builds use `npx cap sync android` after each web build to refresh Capacitor assets.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation, single quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript, and keep semicolons consistent with ESLint output.
- Prefer `<script setup lang="ts">` SFCs, Composition API patterns, and strongly typed props and emits.
- Name Vue components in `PascalCase.vue`, composables as `useThing.ts`, and store modules or utilities in `camelCase`.
- Keep platform conditionals isolated inside helpers so Ionic-specific logic is easy to mock.

## Testing Guidelines
- Mirror feature folders with `FeatureName.spec.ts` files under `tests/unit`; stub capacitor plugins with `vi.mock` to keep unit tests deterministic.
- E2E specs (`tests/e2e/**/*.cy.ts`) should cover critical navigation and scanning flows; tag slow paths with `@slow` for easier filtering.
- Run `npm run test:unit -- --run` and `npm run test:e2e` before pushing; include failing artifacts in the PR if they surface.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- The repository has no established history yet—follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add asset detail view`) in the imperative mood.
- Keep commits focused on one logical change, include relevant tests, and avoid formatting-only commits.
- Pull requests need a concise summary, affected routes or screens, test evidence (`npm run lint`, `npm run test:*`), and screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- Link related issues and call out any platform-specific follow-up (Android/iOS) so reviewers can validate synchronously.
